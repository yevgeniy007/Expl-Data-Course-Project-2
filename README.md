# Exploratoty data analysis, course project 2
# For  this assigmnent, a US air pollution data set is used
# With the pollution data annual breakdown for 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008, each three years apart
# ------------------------------------------------------------------

This dataset is characterized by a wide variation of emissions data and the likely presenc of high outlier readings 
and in order to perform exploratiry analysis correctly we need to look in the change of the mean values of emissions
and into the veriations of data, because the outliers may affect the means
