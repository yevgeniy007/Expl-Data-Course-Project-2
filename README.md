# Exploratoty data analysis, course project 2 
For  this assigmnent, a US air pollution data set is used
With the pollution data annual breakdown for 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008, each three years apart
# ----------------------------------------------------------

This dataset is characterized by a wide variation of emissions data and the likely presence of high outlier readings 
and in order to perform exploratiry analysis correctly we need to look in the change of the mean values of emissions
and into the veriations of data, because the outliers may affect the means; 
The data can be visualised by using boxplot charts, which is the main type of presentation in this assignment 

# A summary of answers to project assignment 
 
# 1: Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? 
a. Total emissions from PM2.5 in the US have decreased in the from 1999 to 2008

b. however the mean annual values may be affected by the wide spread of data due to variability and heterogeneity 

c. The bar plot shows a decrease of mean annual values 

d. The bar plot for the MEDIAN values suggests skewed distributions of emission values; this can be further explored by looking at different sources of emissions 

# 2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland from 1999 to 2008? 
Total emissions from PM2.5 in the Baltimore City, Maryland have decreased between 1999 and 2002, then increased between 2002 and 2005 and then decreased again between 2005 and 2008

#3. Of the four types of sources indicated by  the type variable,  which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City?  Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008?
